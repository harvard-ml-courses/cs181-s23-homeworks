    "PyTorch is an open source machine learning framework based on the Torch library. It is currently by far the most popular library for implementing machine learning projects. Unlike in NumPy, PyTorch allows you to perform tensor operations on the GPU. This, alongside dynamic auto-differentiation, makes PyTorch extremely performative and flexible. Learning to use PyTorch will mean you are able to prototype, train, and test production-quality models for work or research.\n",

    "All the building blocks for machine learning architectures (activation functions, loss functions, neural network layers, etc) are written for you. Exploring everything PyTorch offers takes patience. If you want to and dive further into deep learning, we highly encourage you to read through the [D2L (d2l.ai)](https://d2l.ai/) course, which gives tutorials on how to write even the most state of the art deep learning models from scratch."

    "We also need to be able to evaluate our model prediction $\\hat {\\mathbf y}$ with the true label $\\mathbf y$. We can do this through with cross entropy loss. If $K$ is the number of categories we have, then $\\hat {\\mathbf y}$ and $\\mathbf y$ are $K$-dimensional one hot vectors. With this representation, cross entropy loss is defined as $$\\ell(\\hat {\\mathbf y}, \\mathbf y) = -\\sum_{k=1}^K \\mathbf y_i \\log \\hat {\\mathbf y}_i.$$ Note that the way we structured our neural network, only $\\hat {\\mathbf y}$ is one hot encoded, and the labels $y$ coming from the MNIST training set are integers. This means we can much more simply write $$\\ell(\\hat {\\mathbf y}, y) = -\\log \\hat {\\mathbf y}_y.$$\n",
